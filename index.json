Our universal vocoder offers real-time high-quality speech synthesis on a wide range of use cases. We tested it on 43 internal speakers of diverse age and gender, speaking 20 languages in 17 unique styles, of which 7 voices and 5 styles were not exposed during training. We show that the proposed universal vocoder significantly outperforms speaker-dependent vocoders overall. We also show that the proposed vocoder outperforms several existing neural vocoder architectures in terms of naturalness and universality. These findings are consistent when we further test on more than 300 open-source voices.","tags":["Deep Learning","Text-to-Speech"],"title":"Universal Neural Vocoding with Parallel WaveNet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Philippe Vert (Prof.)","Yunlong Jiao (T.A.)"],"categories":null,"content":"Master course at African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI).\nThis course covers basic concepts in machine learning in high dimension, and the importance of regularization.

First we introduce a weighted version of the Kendall kernel, which allows to weight unequally the contributions of different item pairs in the permutations depending on their ranks.

Second, we propose a supervised approach to learn the weights by jointly optimizing them with the function estimated by a kernel machine. Third, while the Kendall kernel considers pairwise comparison between items, we extend it by considering higher-order comparisons among tuples of items and show that the supervised approach of learning the weights can be systematically generalized to higher-order permutation kernels.","tags":["Machine Learning","Kernel Methods"],"title":"The Weighted Kendall and High-order Kernels for Permutations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunlong Jiao","Jean-Philippe Vert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530316800,"objectID":"03148a224edff158abb9c88c1d98608e","permalink":"https://YunlongJiao.github.io/publication/jiao2018kendall/","publishdate":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiao2018kendall/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the widely used Kendall tau correlation coefficient, and the related Mallows kernel, are positive definite kernels for permutations.

We perform breast cancer survival analysis using a large gene expression dataset and a protein-protein interaction network obtained from a public database, and demonstrate that the proposed methods are able to improve gene selection in terms of stability, connectivity and interpretability while achieving competitive performance of survival risk prediction.

However, it is often difficult to interpret the list of genes in a prognostic signature regarding the underlying biological processes responsible for disease progression or therapeutic response. A particularly interesting alternative to gene-based biomarkers is mechanistic biomarkers, derived from signaling pathway activities, which are known to play a key role in cancer progression and thus provide more informative insights into cellular functions involved in cancer mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that pathway-level features, such as the activity of signaling circuits, outperform conventional gene-level features in prediction performance in breast cancer prognosis. We also show that the proposed classification scheme can even suggest, in addition to relevant signaling circuits related to disease outcome, a list of genes that do not code for signaling proteins whose contribution to cancer prognosis potentially supplements the mechanisms detected by pathway analysis.","tags":["Bioinformatics"],"title":"Signaling Pathway Activities Improve Prognosis for Breast Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elsa Bernard","Yunlong Jiao","Erwan Scornet","Veronique Stoven","Thomas Walter","Jean-Philippe Vert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506384000,"objectID":"2a563e39e17027a492241037c9b501b7","permalink":"https://YunlongJiao.github.io/publication/bernard2017kernel/","publishdate":"2017-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bernard2017kernel/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of high-throughput *in vitro* assays to study quantitatively the toxicity of chemical compounds on genetically characterized human-derived cell lines paves the way to *predictive toxicogenetics*, where one would be able to predict the toxicity of any particular compound on any particular individual.

Improving cancer prognosis has been one of the problems of primary interest towards better clinical management and treatment decision making for cancer patients. With the rapid advancement of genomic profiling technologies in the past decades, easy availability of a substantial amount of genomic data for medical research has been motivating the currently popular trend of using computational tools, especially machine learning in the era of data science, to discover molecular biomarkers regarding prognosis improvement. This thesis is conceived following two lines of approaches intended to address two major challenges arising in genomic data analysis for breast cancer prognosis from a methodological standpoint of machine learning: rank-based approaches for improved molecular prognosis and network-guided approaches for enhanced biomarker discovery. Furthermore, the methodologies developed and investigated in this thesis, pertaining respectively to learning with rank data and learning on graphs, have a significant contribution to several branches of machine learning, concerning applications across but not limited to cancer biology and social choice theory.","tags":["Machine Learning","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Rank-based Molecular Prognosis and Network-guided Biomarker Discovery for Breast Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Heinemann","Stefan Kobel","Sven Dahlmanns","Jean-Philippe Vert","Yunlong Jiao"],"categories":null,"content":"Patent application filed by Roche Diagnostics GmbH, F.
