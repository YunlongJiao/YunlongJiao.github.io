First we introduce a weighted version of the Kendall kernel, which allows to weight unequally the contributions of different item pairs in the permutations depending on their ranks. Like the Kendall kernel, we show that the weighted version is invariant to relabeling of items and can be computed efficiently in $O(n \\ln(n))$ operations, where $n$ is the number of items in the permutation. Second, we propose a supervised approach to learn the weights by jointly optimizing them with the function estimated by a kernel machine. Third, while the Kendall kernel considers pairwise comparison between items, we extend it by considering higher-order comparisons among tuples of items and show that the supervised approach of learning the weights can be systematically generalized to higher-order permutation kernels.","tags":null,"title":"The Weighted Kendall and High-order Kernels for Permutations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Y Jiao**","JP Vert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530313200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549308414,"objectID":"03148a224edff158abb9c88c1d98608e","permalink":"https://YunlongJiao.github.io/publication/jiao2018kendall/","publishdate":"2018-06-30T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jiao2018kendall/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the widely used Kendall tau correlation coefficient, and the related Mallows kernel, are positive definite kernels for permutations.

However, it is often difficult to interpret the list of genes in a prognostic signature regarding the underlying biological processes responsible for disease progression or therapeutic response. A particularly interesting alternative to gene-based biomarkers is mechanistic biomarkers, derived from signaling pathway activities, which are known to play a key role in cancer progression and thus provide more informative insights into cellular functions involved in cancer mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that pathway-level features, such as the activity of signaling circuits, outperform conventional gene-level features in prediction performance in breast cancer prognosis. We also show that the proposed classification scheme can even suggest, in addition to relevant signaling circuits related to disease outcome, a list of genes that do not code for signaling proteins whose contribution to cancer prognosis potentially supplements the mechanisms detected by pathway analysis.","tags":null,"title":"Signaling Pathway Activities Improve Prognosis for Breast Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Bernard\u003csup\u003e\u0026dagger;\u003c/sup\u003e","**Y Jiao**\u003csup\u003e\u0026dagger;\u003c/sup\u003e","E Scornet","V Stoven","T Walter","JP Vert"],"categories":null,"content":"\u0026dagger; These authors contributed equally to this work.\n","date":1506380400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549308414,"objectID":"2a563e39e17027a492241037c9b501b7","permalink":"https://YunlongJiao.github.io/publication/bernard2017kernel/","publishdate":"2017-09-26T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bernard2017kernel/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of high-throughput *in vitro* assays to study quantitatively the toxicity of chemical compounds on genetically characterized human-derived cell lines paves the way to *predictive toxicogenetics*, where one would be able to predict the toxicity of any particular compound on any particular individual.

Improving cancer prognosis has been one of the problems of primary interest towards better clinical management and treatment decision making for cancer patients. With the rapid advancement of genomic profiling technologies in the past decades, easy availability of a substantial amount of genomic data for medical research has been motivating the currently popular trend of using computational tools, especially machine learning in the era of data science, to discover molecular biomarkers regarding prognosis improvement. This thesis is conceived following two lines of approaches intended to address two major challenges arising in genomic data analysis for breast cancer prognosis from a methodological standpoint of machine learning: rank-based approaches for improved molecular prognosis and network-guided approaches for enhanced biomarker discovery. Furthermore, the methodologies developed and investigated in this thesis, pertaining respectively to learning with rank data and learning on graphs, have a significant contribution to several branches of machine learning, concerning applications across but not limited to cancer biology and social choice theory.","tags":null,"title":"Rank-based Molecular Prognosis and Network-guided Biomarker Discovery for Breast Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Y Jiao**","JP Vert","F Heinemann","S Dahlmanns","S Kobel"],"categories":null,"content":"Patent application filed by Roche Diagnostics GmbH, F.

Many contributions have thus established various results to apprehend this complexity. In this paper we introduce a practical method to predict, for a ranking and a dataset, how close the Kemeny consensus(es) are to this ranking. A major strength of this method is its generality: it does not require any assumption on the dataset nor the ranking.
